When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile.

Everything can change in the blink of an eye, but don't worry, God never blinks.
 
Take a deep breath. It calms the mind.
 
Get rid of anything that isn't useful. Clutter weighs you down in many ways.
 
Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger.
 
It's never too late to be happy. But it's all up to you and no one else.
 
When it comes to going after what you love in life, don't take no for an answer.
 
Burn the candles, use the nice sheets, wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special.
 
Over prepare, then go with the flow.
 
Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple.

Always choose life.
 
Forgive
 
What other people think of you is none of your business.
 
Time heals almost everything. Give time time.
 
However good or bad a situation is, it will change.
 
Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.
 
Believe in miracles.
 
God loves you because of who God is, not because of anything you did or didn't do.
 
Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now.
 
Growing old beats the alternative of dying young.
 
Your children get only one childhood.
 
All that truly matters in the end is that you loved.
 
Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere.
 
If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's, we'd grab ours back.
 
Envy is a waste of time. Accept what you already have, not what you need
 
The best is yet to come..
 
No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up.
 
Yield.
 
Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift."

Fortunately for me, my self-knowledge has transcended that, and I have come to understand that life is best to be lived and not to be conceptualized. I am happy because I am growing daily, and I am honestly not knowing where the limit lies. To be certain, every day there can be a revelation or a new discovery.

“What you habitually think largely determines what you will ultimately become.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“A powerful athlete is not a strong athlete, but one who can exert his strength quickly. Since power equals force times speed, if the athlete learns to make faster movements he increases his power, even though the contractile pulling strength of his muscles remains unchanged. Thus, a smaller man who can swing faster may hit as hard or as far as the heavier man who swings slowly.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“After all, all knowledge simply means self-knowledge.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“Knowledge will give you power, but character respect.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“The biggest adversary in our life is ourselves. We are what we are, in a sense, because of the dominating thoughts we allow to gather in our head. All concepts of self-improvement, all actions and paths we take, relate solely to our abstract image of ourselves. Life is limited only by how we really see ourselves and feel about our being. A great deal of pure self-knowledge and inner understanding allows us to lay an all-important foundation for the structure of our life from which we can perceive and take the right avenues.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“When there is freedom from mechanical conditioning, there is simplicity. The classical man is just a bundle of routine, ideas and tradition. If you follow the classical pattern, you are understanding the routine, the tradition, the shadow – you are not understanding yourself.”_ — **Bruce Lee**

“Flow in the living moment. — We are always in a process of becoming and nothing is fixed. Have no rigid system in you, and you’ll be flexible to change with the ever changing.

“It’s not what you give, it’s the way you give it._ “ — **Bruce Lee**

Choosing battles wisely.

“Focus on what you control.” — It’s unhelpful to dwell on things outside of your control.

“Not wanting something is as good as having it.” — If you don’t want something, you’re just as satisfied as someone who has it. Naval Ravikant says that “…desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.”

“Perfect is a myth. Make a choice.” — Start and iterate.

“Use models.” — Don’t recreate the wheel. Learn from others and save time.

“Start super simple.” — Make the simplest version first. Don’t complicate things. Build an MVP. Or a concierge MVP.

“Set goals. And work backwards.” — Use big goals and small goals. Milestones can expose whether you undershot or overshot.

“Don’t read/watch the news. Skewed incentives.” — The news is a war on our attention. We are frightened into coming back to find out what else to be afraid of. This leads to availability bias and pessimism. Some of us are more afraid to fly than drive. Counteract the news with positive propaganda.

“You’re the average of the 5 people you surround yourself with.” — This goes beyond people. What books, podcasts, videos or music do you consume?

“Stay away from negative people.” — Vibes are contagious.

“Listen to your gut.” — Don’t ignore your instincts.

“Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.” — Hard decisions are often the most important. Ben Horowitz tells us to run towards the fear.

“Think probabilistically.” — Think grey. Not black and white. This comes from Annie Duke and her book, Thinking in Bets. Assign percentages to your beliefs instead of speaking in absolutes.

“It’s easier to resist in the beginning than the end.” — Mistakes become harder to correct the longer they linger. Sunk costs play tricks on us. Suck it up and rip the bandaid off now. Toxic relationships, bad hires and tough conversations. It’s immediate pain versus chronic pain.

“To know all is to forgive all.” — You would be more understanding if you knew everything about a person. Look closer when something doesn’t make sense.

“The most important part of business is the market. It’s easier to ride a wave than it is to make one.” — A good team won’t survive a bad market. A good product won’t survive a bad market. A bad team with a bad product can survive in a good market. Pick hungry markets. This comes from Marc Andreessen who wrote The Only Thing That Matters.

“Does the business have network effects? Does it require funding?” — Network effects determine the number and size of the businesses a market. These are winner take most games.
