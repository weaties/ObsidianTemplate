TL;DR - This process will allow you to easily create a [daily note](https://www.dsebastien.net/how-i-use-daily-notes/) as well as notes for every meeting that you attend with links to all of the people. making it easy to keep track of the folks that you talk to and why.   My opinionated opinion on all of this is to create a Folder for each week of the year, within the folder for the month of that week.

Howdy - thanks for taking a look at this Vault.  I (Dan Weatbrook) created it before I retired in 2024 to show how I use Obsidian to help me keep track of the different meetings and topics I am in.

First there are a lot of [[Obsidian resources]] that you can use to familiarize yourself with.   l will assume that you have a basic understanding of Obsidian [Internal Links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) and how to get around in here.

There are also a couple of [[Other Tools and their setup]] that I have setup and rely on for working with this. ([[Other Tools and their setup#^a9d489|Cleanshot]] and [[Other Tools and their setup#^0db523|Raycast]]). 

OK - enough of the preliminaries...   Here's how it works

## Morning Pages

Every morning I use `cmd-d` to create the daily note for the day, and I spend 30 minutes writing my [morning pages]([What are Morning Pages? How One New Habit Changed My Life](https://littlecoffeefox.com/morning-pages-changed-life/)) 

## Meetings

### capturing attendees
For each meeting i'm in I:
1. use `opt-cmd-m` to create a meeting note for the meeting, using the title of the meeting form outlook for the name ![[Pasted image 20241021163000.png]] (note - watch out for ":" and "/" and "\" in the title of the meeting, those can create subdirectories you don't expect)
2. use CleanShotx to grab a screen shot of everyone in the meeting and paste that in the attendees section of the Meeting Note. ![[CleanShot 2024-10-21 at 16.33.29.png]]
3. Bring up the list of attendees in the meeting, and expand that window to see all of the attendees
4. Use CleanShotX's `Capture Text OCR` feature to grab the names to your clipboard.![[CleanShot 2024-10-21 at 16.35.30.png]]
5. Use the [[Other Tools and their setup#^0db523|RayCast command]] to clean that up, and wrap each line in Obsidian internal links (`[[` and `]]`)  ![[CleanShot 2024-10-21 at 16.37.53.png]]
6. Paste that after the screen shot of the attendees head shots.





### Take your notes in the meeting
Go ahead, write down anything that comes to mind during the meeting.  you can give yourself a reminder of something that you need to do with the [task](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) mechanism.  You can also create Key Take Aways (KTA's) that will get extracted into the Daily and Weekly notes.
## People

There is a template [[People-Template]] that you can apply to any of the people files
![[CleanShot 2024-10-21 at 16.53.02.png]]

That will give you a standard look as well as create a link to all of the places that person is mentioned, and pull out the Key Take Aways (KTA) from each of those files.

## Weekly - 
At the end of the week, create a weekly file 
![[CleanShot 2024-10-21 at 16.54.25.png]]
it will have a list of all of the KTA's for the week that will give you a reminder of all of the things you thought you wanted to take away from each meeting.
