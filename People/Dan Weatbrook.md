## How I like to work

- People over process 
    - process is required, but not sufficient.
    - Knowing and liking each other gets us all a lot further
- Slack over Email 
    - But meet people where they are, and post important things to both
- Markdown is king 
    - Plaintext over proprietary formatting
    - Don’t paste “naked” url’s to jira - see [[WPROG32-626] How to easily copy links to jira that include the title of the issue - Expedia JIRA](https://jira.expedia.biz/browse/WPROG32-626)
    - Be aware of [The Differences Between Various URL Formats for a Confluence Page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/the-differences-between-various-url-formats-for-a-confluence-page-278692715.html)
- Transparency 
    - communicate in public Slack channels where appropriate - Very little really needs to be said in private (but there is some stuff)
    - Publish meeting recordings and notes - you only miss things like that when you don’t have them.
    - You never know where help might come from, but no one can help you if they can’t connect the dots.
    - Track it in jira
    - Don’t copy things in confluence. Use extracts and the like
- Self Service 
    - I Look for answers before I ask for them.
- Organized And consistent 
    - Make it so that others can self service what they are looking for.
    - Make names consistent.
- Done is shipped to prod 
    - Don’t mark it done if it’s not in production.
    - Treat your tools with the care you treat the product. 
        - Ask me about the difference between the island packet and the Catalina manufacturing facilities.
